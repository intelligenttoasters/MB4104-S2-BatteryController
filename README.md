# MB4104-S2-BatteryController
This is a library and application code to manage the PowerTech S2 2048Wh Portable Battery. This is also known under the Jaycar part code MB4104. A HomeAssistant MQTT client also publishes the battery statistics and relay switches to HomeAssistant.

This battery has an IOT button that when pressed will enable bluetooth and WIFI and allow the registration of the battery linked to your account. Once the battery is linked to your WIFI, it has an open port that allows a query/response to monitor the battery statistics. Control of the power relays is also possible with this library.

## Registration Process
The first step is to register the battery to your account. Follow the instructions in the manual to download and install the mobile app, then register a new account.

After registration, make sure bluetooth is on. Also connect your phone WIFI to the WIFI connection that you will use for the battery.

Follow the prompts to search for a new battery. When it's found, register the battery to your account. After this is complete, you will see your battery stats on your phone.
Now you'll see a banner that invites you to connect your battery to WIFI. Touch the banner and it will go through the process of requesting the password for your connected WIFI. 

_You can't change your AP, which is why we connected to correct AP earlier_.

After providing the password, your battery will connect to your WIFI. You should see the WIFI symbol on the battery stop flashing.
Now you can turn **off** your bluetooth. If everything is set up correctly, you'll still be able to see your battery stats and control the relays from the app.

## Download and run the test application
Now clone the Git repository and run python scripts/ups_dashboard.py --host <battery_ip_address> --verbose

If all went well, you should see your battery stats in the console. You may need to check your router DHCP server to find the IP address. 

## Run the HomeAssistant monitor
Running the HomeAssistant monitor is as simple as running the python script...tbc...
